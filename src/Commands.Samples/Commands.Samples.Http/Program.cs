var builder = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args);

// First, we are going to configure the host to use HTTP components, which is required for the communication over RESTful APIs. 
// The ConfigureHttpComponents method allows us to set up the HTTP listener, which will listen for incoming requests on a specified prefix (in this case, http://localhost:5000/).
builder.ConfigureHttpComponents(context =>
{
    // This sets up the HTTP listener to listen on the specified prefix. This operation is essential for the HTTP server to function correctly.
    // If no prefix is specified, the host will fail on run as it cannot start the HTTP listener.
    context.WithListener(listener =>
    {
        listener.Prefixes.Add("http://localhost:5000/");

    // Option configuration defines how components created by UseComponents will behave. 
    // This (currently) includes defining parsers and validation of component names.
    context.ConfigureOptions(options =>
    {

    });
});

// By setting the minimum log level to Debug, we can see detailed logs about command registration and execution.
builder.ConfigureLogging(logging =>
{
    logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
});
 
// After configuring the host, we build it. At this point, all improperly configured settings will throw exceptions, forcing the host to fail if there are any issues.
var host = builder.Build();

// Next, we register components with the host. Components can be commands, command groups, or any other type that implements the IComponent interface.
// In HTTP hosting, commands are typically registered as HTTP endpoints that can be invoked via HTTP requests.
// However, you can also register other types of components that can be used in the command pipeline of the CommandExecutionFactory service available in the host by default.
host.UseComponents(components =>
{
    // This adds all exported types from the current assembly to the component tree, if they are implementations of CommandModule. Other types are skipped.
    components.AddRange(typeof(Program).Assembly.GetExportedTypes());

    // This adds a command that can be invoked via HTTP GET requests under the following url: http://localhost:5000/ping.
    // The command responds with a simple "OK!" message.
    components.Add(new Command([HttpGet] () =>
    {
        return HttpResult.Ok("OK!");
    }, "ping"));

    // This adds a command that can be invoked via HTTP GET requests under the following url: http://localhost:5000/help.
    // The command lists all available commands in the component tree, providing a simple way to discover what commands are available.
    components.Add(new Command([HttpGet] (IComponentProvider components, IContext context) =>
    {
        var commands = components.Components.GetCommands();

        var response = new StringBuilder("Available commands:\n");

        foreach (var command in commands)
            response.AppendLine($"- {command}");

        return HttpResult.Ok(response.ToString());
    }, "help"));
});

// Finally, we run the host. This will start the HTTP server and begin listening for incoming requests.
await host.RunAsync();
