    ///             <see cref="Async"/> is a setting to be treated with care. 
    ///             Instead of waiting for the full execution before returning control, the execution will return immediately after the entrypoint is called, slipping thread for the rest of execution. 
    ///             When more than one input source is expected to be handled, this is generally the advised method of execution.
